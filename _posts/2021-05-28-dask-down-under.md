## What is Dask Down Under?

> Dask down under is a chance for everyone in Oceania to forge links and build community here in our backyard. Dask down under we feature talks, tutorials and panel discussions on using Dask to accelerate research. All levels from beginner to expert are encouraged to attend.

Dask Down Under involved two days of events:
* 5 talks
* 2 tutorials
* 1 panel discussion
* 1 meet and greet networking event

## Who came?

There was a strong geoscience theme across Dask Down Under. This reflects the strong scientific community we have in these areas. People came from government organisations, universities, and industry.

We expected most attendees would be based in the Asia-Pacific region, since those were the timezones targeted by these events.

Unexpectedly, we also saw a lot of extra traffic at the talks on day one, likely from US timezones. Publicity from Dask Summit emails and tweets mentioning Dask Down Under resulted in a lot of people stopping by to watch. This more than doubled our live attendance during the first event. It was great to see so much interest coming from other parts of the world, too.

## Watch the talks

You can watch the talks and tutorials from the Dask Dwon Under workshop on the Dask youtube channel.
The [full playlist for the workshop is available here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ0vO2F_f6OAXBfb_SAF2EbJve9k1vkQX).

### Panel discussion

A panel discussion was held, bringing together a diverse group of users from novice to expert, academic to commercial. We hope this discussion will start a conversation about using Dask in Australia, how we build our community, contribute and stay in touch with the rest of the world.

> Some people in the Pangeo community might be aware of the Python for Atmosphere and Ocean Science (PyAOS) website, which was established a number of years ago to provide information and resources to the user community: https://pyaos.github.io/
>
> In order to keep the site up-to-date, we are launching our first ever PyAOS census. It would be great if members of the Pangeo community could take a few minutes to fill out the survey:
