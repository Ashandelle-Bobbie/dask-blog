When thinking about the bottlenecks in large-scale computation, we often focus on CPU: we want to use more CPU cores in order to get faster results.
But memory can also be a bottleneck, leading to out-of-memory errors, or forcing under-utilization of available CPUs.

Unfortunately, memory usage can often be difficult to measure and understand.
So in this article I'm going to introduce [dask-memusage](https://github.com/itamarst/dask-memusage/), a tool that lets your see peak memory usage of the tasks in your Dask execution graph.
This can help you determine necessary hardware resources, and point at code that might need its memory usage reduced.

Once you've discovered where the memory bottleneck is, you might be able to ensure maximum hardware utilization by tweaking your configuration, especially if you're running on cloud VMs.
Or, you can try to reduce memory usage, for example by using the [Fil memory profiler](https://pythonspeed.com/fil) to further pinpoint the exact lines of code responsible for high memory usage.

## The problem: fixed processing chunks and a high memory/CPU ratio

Before moving on to how `dask-memusage` works and how you can use it, it's worth understanding the real-world problem that motivated it.

I was working on the image processing pipeline for a spatial gene sequencing device, which could report not just which genes were being expressed but also where they were in a 3D volume of cells.
In order to get this information, a specialized microscope took snapshots of the cell culture or tissue.

The resulting data volume was quite large, and certain subsets of snapshots had to be processed together as a unit.
From a computational standpoint, we effectively had a series of inputs X0, X1, X2, ... that could be independently processed by a function `f()`.

The problem was that the internal processing of `f()` could not easily be parallelized further.
From a CPU scheduling perspective, this is fine, it's still an embarrassingly parallel problem given the large of number of X inputs.

For example, my desktop computer has 4 CPU cores, so to process the data I could start four processes, and each would max out a single core.
If I had 12 inputs and each processing step took about the same time, they might run as follows:

* CPU0: `f(X0)`, `f(X4)`, `f(X8)`
* CPU1: `f(X1)`, `f(X5)`, `f(X9)`
* CPU2: `f(X2)`, `f(X6)`, `f(X10)`
* CPU3: `f(X3)`, `f(X7)`, `f(X11)`

CPU is not the only bottleneck however, there is also memory to take into account, and this is where the problems started.

Let's say each call to `f(Xi)` takes 12GB of RAM.
That means to fully utilize 4 CPUs, I would need 48GB of RAMâ€”but what if my computer only has 16GB of RAM?

**Even though my computer has 4 CPUs, I can only utilize one CPU on a computer with 16GB RAM, because I don't have enough RAM to run more than one task in parallel.**
In practice, these tasks ran in the cloud, where I could ensure the necessary RAM/core ratio was preserved by choosing the right pre-configured VM instances.
And on some clouds you can freely set the amount of RAM and number of CPU cores for each virtual machine you spin up.

But in order to provision hardware appropriately, I needed to know how much peak memory each task was using.

## Introducing `dask-memusage`

`dask-memusage` is a tool for measuring peak memory usage for each task in the Dask execution graph.

* Per *task* because Dask executes code as a graph of tasks, and the graph determines how much parallelism can be used.
* *Peak* memory is important, because that is the bottleneck.
  It doesn't matter if average memory usage per task is 4GB, if two tasks need 12GB each at the same time your computer needs 24GB of RAM to be available.

The interaction of the task graph and parallelism best illustrated with an example.
Let's consider some trivial code that squares some numbers and then sums them:

```python
from dask.bag import from_sequence

def square(x):
    return x * x

result = from_sequence(range(5)).map(square).sum()
```

We can visualize the task graph, the series of steps that Dask will try to execute:

```python
result.visualize(filename="example1.png", rankdir="TD")
```

Here's what it looks like:

<img src="/images/dask_memusage/example1.png"  style="width: 75%; margin: 2em;">

As we'd expect, squaring can happen in parallel, but summing the resulting values eventually devolves to a single action without parallelism because eventually we're combining down to a single result.

For memory use purposes, in this particular example the peak memory usage would worst case be the peak memory usage of `square()` multiplied by the level of parallelism.
So in the highly unlikely event that squaring a number takes 1GB of RAM, we'd need 10GB of RAM if we ran 10 `square()` calls in parallel.

# Using `dask-memusage`

Let's try a slightly more realistic example: we're going to count the occurrence of words in some text files, and then report the top-10 most common words in each file.
You can imagine we might also combine the data later on, but we won't bother with that in this simple example.

```python
import sys
import gc
from time import sleep
from pathlib import Path
from dask.bag import from_sequence
from collections import Counter
from dask.distributed import Client, LocalCluster
import dask_memusage


def calculate_top_10(file_path: Path):
    gc.collect()  # See notes below

    # Load the file
    with open(file_path) as f:
        data = f.read()

    # Count the words
    counts = Counter()
    for word in data.split():
        counts[word.strip(".,'\"").lower()] += 1

    # Choose the top 10:
    by_count = sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    sleep(0.1)  # See notes below
    return (file_path.name, by_count[-10:])


def main(directory):
    # Setup the calculation:

    # Create a 4-process cluster (running locally). Note only one thread
    # per-worker; this is important or you won't get correct results.
    cluster = LocalCluster(n_workers=4, threads_per_worker=1,
                           memory_limit=None)
    # Install dask-memusage:
    dask_memusage.install(cluster.scheduler, "memusage.csv")
    client = Client(cluster)

    # Create the task graph:
    files = from_sequence(Path(directory).iterdir())
    graph = files.map(calculate_top_10)
    graph.visualize(filename="example2.png", rankdir="TD")

    # Run the calculations:
    for result in graph.compute():
        print(result)
    # ... do something with results ...


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main(sys.argv[1])
```

Here's what the task graph looks like:

<img src="/images/dask_memusage/example2.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 2em;">

Plenty of parallelism!

We can run the program on some files:

```shell-session
$ pip install dask[bag] dask_memusage
$ python example2.py files/
('frankenstein.txt', [('that', 1016), ('was', 1021), ('in', 1180), ('a', 1438), ('my', 1751), ('to', 2164), ('i', 2754), ('of', 2761), ('and', 3025), ('the', 4339)])
('pride_and_prejudice.txt', [('she', 1660), ('i', 1730), ('was', 1832), ('in', 1904), ('a', 1981), ('her', 2142), ('and', 3503), ('of', 3705), ('to', 4188), ('the', 4492)])
('greatgatsby.txt', [('that', 564), ('was', 760), ('he', 770), ('in', 849), ('i', 999), ('to', 1197), ('of', 1224), ('a', 1440), ('and', 1565), ('the', 2543)])
('big.txt', [('his', 40032), ('was', 45356), ('that', 47924), ('he', 48276), ('a', 83228), ('in', 86832), ('to', 114184), ('and', 152284), ('of', 159888), ('the', 314908)])
```

As one would expect, the most common words are stem words, but there is still some variation in order.

Next, let's look at the results from `dask-memusage`.

## `dask-memusage` output, and how it works

You'll notice that the actual use of `dask-memusage` involves just one extra line, other than the import:

```python
dask_memusage.install(cluster.scheduler, "memusage.csv")
```

What this will do is poll the process at intervals for peak memory usage, broken down by task.
In this case, here's what `memusage.csv` looks like:

```csv
task_key,min_memory_mb,max_memory_mb
"('from_sequence-3637e6ff937ef8488894df60a80f62ed', 3)",51.2421875,51.2421875
"('from_sequence-3637e6ff937ef8488894df60a80f62ed', 0)",51.70703125,51.70703125
"('from_sequence-3637e6ff937ef8488894df60a80f62ed', 1)",51.28125,51.78515625
"('from_sequence-3637e6ff937ef8488894df60a80f62ed', 2)",51.30859375,51.30859375
"('calculate_top_10-afc867e38c3bd0aac8c18bb00d3634ca', 2)",56.19140625,56.19140625
"('calculate_top_10-afc867e38c3bd0aac8c18bb00d3634ca', 0)",51.70703125,54.26953125
"('calculate_top_10-afc867e38c3bd0aac8c18bb00d3634ca', 1)",52.30078125,52.30078125
"('calculate_top_10-afc867e38c3bd0aac8c18bb00d3634ca', 3)",51.48046875,384.00390625
```

For each task in the graph we are told minimum memory usage and peak memory usage, in MB.

In more readable form:

| task_key                                                   | min_memory_mb | max_memory_mb |
| "('from_sequence-3637e6ff937ef8488894df60a80f62ed', 3)"    |    51.2421875 |    51.2421875 |
| "('from_sequence-3637e6ff937ef8488894df60a80f62ed', 0)"    |   51.70703125 |   51.70703125 |
| "('from_sequence-3637e6ff937ef8488894df60a80f62ed', 1)"    |      51.28125 |   51.78515625 |
| "('from_sequence-3637e6ff937ef8488894df60a80f62ed', 2)"    |   51.30859375 |   51.30859375 |
| "('calculate_top_10-afc867e38c3bd0aac8c18bb00d3634ca', 2)" |   56.19140625 |   56.19140625 |
| "('calculate_top_10-afc867e38c3bd0aac8c18bb00d3634ca', 0)" |   51.70703125 |   54.26953125 |
| "('calculate_top_10-afc867e38c3bd0aac8c18bb00d3634ca', 1)" |   52.30078125 |   52.30078125 |
| "('calculate_top_10-afc867e38c3bd0aac8c18bb00d3634ca', 3)" |   51.48046875 |  384.00390625 |

The bottom four lines are the interesting ones; all four start with a minimum memory usage of ~50MB RAM, and then perhaps memory increases as the code runs.
How much it increases presumably depends on the size of the files; most of them are quite small, so memory usage doesn't change much.
**One file uses much more maximum memory than the others, 384MB of RAM; presumably it's `big.txt` which is 25MB, since the other files are all smaller than 1MB.**

The mechanism used, polling peak process memory, has some limitations:

* You'll notice there's a `gc.collect()` at the top of the `calculate_top_10()`; this ensures we don't count memory from previous code that hasn't been cleaned up yet.
* There's also a `sleep()` at the bottom of `calculate_top_10()`.
  Because polling is used, tasks that run too quickly won't get accurate information.
* Finally, because polling is per-process, you can't run multiple threads per worker, otherwise you'll get results that combine memory usage of multiple tasks.

## Interpreting the data

What we've learned is that memory usage of `calculate_top_10()` grows with file size; this can let us [characterize the memory requirements for the workload](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/estimating-memory-usage/), creating a model saying "for these file sizes and this level of parallelism we will need this much RAM."
And that can guide our hardware specifications.

However, we might also notice that the memory usage seems rather high: for a 25MB file, we're using 330MB of RAM to count words.
Thinking through how an ideal version of this code might work, we ought to be able to process the file with much less memory.

**And that's another way in which `dask-memusage` can be helpful: it can point us at specific code that needs memory usage optimized, at the granularity of a task.**
If you want to dig down further, I've built [a memory profiler called Fil](https://pythonspeed.com/fil) that is expressly designed for finding peak memory usage.
Unlike `dask-memusage`, which can be run on production workloads, Fil slows down your execution and has other limitations I'm currently working on (it doesn't support multiple processes, as of March 2021), so for now it's better used for manual profiling.

We can write a little script that only runs on `big.txt`:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from example2 import calculate_top_10

calculate_top_10(Path("files/big.txt"))
```

Run it under Fil:

```shell-session
$ pip install filprofiler
$ fil-profile run example3.py
```

And the result shows us where the bulk of the memory is being allocated:

<iframe id="peak" src="/images/dask_memusage/peak-memory.svg" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="auto" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Reading in the file takes 8% of memory, but `data.split()` is responsible for 84% of memory.
Perhaps we shouldn't be loading the whole file into memory and splitting the whole file into words, and instead we should be processing the file line by line...

## Next steps

If you're running Dask workloads with the Distributed backend, and you're fine with only having one thread per worker, running with `dask-memusage` will give you real-world per-task memory usage on production workloads.
You can then use this to:

* Fine tune your hardware configuration, so you're not wasting RAM or CPU cores.
* Or, when possible, you can fine tune your chunking size; smaller chunks will use less memory.
* As a starting point for optimizing memory usageâ€”you can then use Fil to figure out which lines of code are responsible.
