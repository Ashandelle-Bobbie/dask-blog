## Executive Summary

There is a lot of work happening in Dask right now on high level graphs. We'd like to share a snapshot of current work in this area. This post is for people interested in technical details of behind the scenes work improving performance in Dask. You don't need to know anything about it in order to use Dask.

## Brief background
What are high level graphs?


High level graphs are a more compact representation of the mapping
https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/high-level-graphs.html

Why are they useful?

They are useful 

[faster scheduling](https://blog.dask.org/2020/07/21/faster-scheduling)

Adam Breindel's post: https://coiled.io/dask-under-the-hood-scheduler-refactor/

> "Starting with Dask 2021.05.0, Dask DataFrame computations will start sending HighLevelGraph's directly from the client to the scheduler by default. Because of this, users should observe a much smaller delay between when they call .compute() and when the corresponding tasks begin running on workers for large DataFrame computations. This is part of Daskâ€™s ongoing performance improvement efforts." https://coiled.io/dask-heartbeat-by-coiled-2021-06-10/

Do I need to change my code to use them?

No, you won't need to change anything. This work is being done under the hood in Dask, and you should see some speed improvements without having to change anything about

## Blockwise layers

### Summary

The `Blockwise` high level graph layer was introduced in the 2020.12.0 Dask release. Since then, there has been a lot of effort made to use `Blockwise` high level graph layer whereever possible for improved performance, most especially for IO operations. The following is a non-exhaustive list.

### Work to date
Highlights include, in no particular order:

1. Merged PR by Rick Zamora: [Use Blockwise for DataFrame IO (parquet, csv, and orc) #7415](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7415)
2. Merged PR by Rick Zamora: [Move read_hdf to Blockwise 7625](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7625)
3. Merged PR by John Kirkham: [Move timeseries and daily-stock to Blockwise #7615](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7615)
4. Merged PR by John Kirkham: [Rewrite da.fromfunction w/ da.blockwise #7704](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7704)

### Ongoing work
Lots of other work with `Blockwise` is currently in progress. In no particular order:

1. Ian Rose: [Blockwise array creation redux #7417](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7417). This PR creates blockwise implementations for the `from_array` and `from_zarr` functions.
2. Rick Zamora: [Move DataFrame from_array and from_pandas to Blockwise #7628](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7628)
3. Richard Berry: [Use BlockwiseDep for map_blocks with block_id or block_info #7686](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7686)


## A high level graph for `map_overlap`

### Summary

Investigating a high level graph for Dask's `map_overlap` is a project driven by user needs. Users have told us that the time taken simply to generate the task graph before any computation takes place can sometimes be unacceptably large.This is a big user experience problem, and so 

### Work to date

1. Merged PR by Genevieve Buckley: [A HighLevelGraph abstract layer for map_overlap #7595](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7595)

This PR defers much of the computation involved in creating the Dask task graph, but does not eliminate it. 

### Ongoing work

Followup work
1. Find number of tasks in overlap layer without materializing the layer #7788 https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/7788
2. Implement cull method for ArrayOverlapLayer #7789 https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/7789

## Slicing and high level graphs
### Summary
### Work to date
 
Open PR: Array slicing HighLevelGraph layer #7655 https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7655

## Visualization

### Summary

Defining a `_repr_html_` method for your classes is a great way to get nice HTML output when you're working with jupyter notebooks. You can read [this post](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/2019/07/04/html-repr) to see more neat HTML representations in other scientific python libraries.

Dask already uses HTML representations in lots of places (like the `Array` and `Dataframe` classes). We now have new HTML representations for `HighLevelGraph` and `Layer` objects, as well as `Scheduler` and `Client` objects in Dask distributed.


### Work to date

1. Merged PR by Jacob Tomlinson: [Add HTML repr to scheduler_info and incorporate into client and cluster reprs #4857](https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/4857)
2. Merged PR by Jacob Tomlinson: [HTML reprs CLient.who_has & Client.has_what](https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/4853)
3. Merged PR by Genevieve Buckley: Implementation of HTML repr for HighLevelGraph layers #7763 https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7763
4. Merged PR by Genevieve Buckley [Automatically show graph visualization in jupyter notebooks #771](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7716)
5. Merged PR by Genevivee Buckley: [Adding chunks and type information to dask high level graphs #7309](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7309). This PR inserts extra information into the high level graph, so that we can create richer visualizations using this extra context later on.

### Example
#### Before:
```
<dask.highlevelgraph.HighLevelGraph at 0x7f9851b7e4f0>
```

#### After (HTML representation):

![Skeleton network of blood vessels within a healthy lung](/images/2021-highlevelgraph-html-repr.png)
#### After (text-only representation):
```python
from dask.datasets import timeseries

ddf = timeseries().shuffle("id", shuffle="tasks").head(compute=False)
ddf.dask
```
```
HighLevelGraph with 3 layers.
<dask.highlevelgraph.HighLevelGraph object at 0x7fc259015b80>

 2. head-1-5-simple-shuffle-cd01443e43b7a6eb9810ad67992c40b6
```

This gives us a much more meaningful representation, and is already being used by developers working on high level graphs.
