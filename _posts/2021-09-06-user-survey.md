## Quotes
> "Dask takes much of the pain out of distribution/parallelization - it tends to clean up after itself and makes expressing embarrassingly parallel problems very elegant." - Jonathan Kenyon

> "I work on climate dynamics, often with pretty large datasets. Dask speeds up processing from days to minutes." - Elizabeth Maroon

## Notes
247 responses to the 2021 survey

 * 247 responses in 2021
 * 239 responses in 2020
 * 259 responses in 2019

A bunch of new questions added:

* Do you use Dask's Performance reports?
* Do you use Dask's Prometheus Metrics?
* How else can Dask improve?
* How is Dask's documentation?
* How is Dask's release frequency?
* How large are your datasets typically?
* How long have you used Dask?
* How satisfied are you with maintainer responsiveness on GitHub?
* If Dask had Long-term support (LTS) releases, would you pin your code to use them?
* If you use a cluster, do you have a need for multiple worker / machine types (e.g. GPU / no GPU, low / high memory) in the same cluster?
* Is Dask resilient enough for you? (e.g. computations complete).
* Is Dask's API stable enough for you?
On a scale of 1 - 5 (1 being hardest, 5 being easiest) how easy is Dask to use?
* What common feature requests do you care about most?  [Improve Resiliency]
* What file formats do you typically work with?
* What industry do you work in?
* Where are your datasets typically stored?
* Which Diagnostic plots are most useful?

No questions were removed/dropped


## For next time
Dask APIs question could be checkbox stype - data is coming out a bit more unstructured than we'd like (but maybe there was an "other box and that's the reason for this)

One person complained about there being too many questions. We didn't solicit that feedback, so they went pretty far out of their way to tell us that.
There were 49 questions asked in the 2021 survey.
There were 18 new questions in 2021 (much longer than last year).
